This is one of the core components of the other new improved project that uses the ideas similar to the ones in the project
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array
and 
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-genaralized-examples-array
with the general name of PhLADiPreLiO (phladiprelio) — Phonetic Languages Approach to
Discovering the Preferred Line Options — that is to the topic of creating
texts and music with some properties, e. g. poetic.

For some theoretical end experimental background for the usage of the library and its successors,
see the papers below:

See for the theoretical idea the paper by the link:

It is the way to evaluate the rhythmic properties accordingly to the basic ideas there 
and to avoid the issues with the previous realization.

P.S.: the author would like to devote this project to support the Foundation GASTROSTARS.
At the day of publication of the first version of the package (12/03/2023) there is
the foundation founder's (this is [Emma Kok](https://www.emmakok.nl)) Birthday. 

On the 01/10/2023 there are International Music Day and [André's Rieu](https://www.andrerieu.com/en) Birthday. So the version 0.4.1.0 is
additionally devoted to him as well as to the Kok family — [Emma](https://emmakok.nl) and [Enzo](https://enzokok.nl) are amazing and fantastic musicians, Vico
works with PhilZuid, Sophie sings in the classical manner. Nathalie Kok with love to her family and 
appreciation for André's Rieu support also celebrates the Day. In Ukraine this day has several 
important celebrations — Intercession of the Holy Theotokos (Pokrova), Cossacks' Day, Day of Defenders of Ukraine (especially relevant during the Russian war against Ukraine).

On the 12/032024 there was a Birthday of Emma Kok, the foundation founder. She turned 16. Therefore, the release 0.10.0.0 is additionally devoted i.e. tributed to her.

Besides, you can support Ukrainian people in various forms.

All support is welcome, including donations for the needs of the Ukrainian army, IDPs and refugees.
